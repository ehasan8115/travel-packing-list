# Project Overview
Travel List is a simple React-based web application that helps you keep track of items you need to pack for your travels. Whether you are going on a weekend getaway or an extended vacation, this app will assist you in organizing and managing your packing list efficiently.

# Features
1. **Add Items**: You can easily add new items to your packing list. Just input the item description and click the "Add" button.
1. **Delete Items**: If you no longer need an item in your packing list, you can delete it by clicking the delete button next to the item.
1. **Toggle Packed Status**: Keep track of the items you have already packed by toggling their packed status. Click the checkbox next to an item to mark it as packed or unpacked.
1. **Sort Items**: You can sort the packing list items based on different criteria:
   - Sort by Input Order: Items will be displayed in the order you added them.
   -	Sort by Description: Arrange items alphabetically based on their descriptions.
   - Sort by Packed Status: Group packed and unpacked items together.
1. **Clear List**: When you're ready to start a new packing list or have completed your preparations, you can clear the entire list with a single click. A confirmation prompt will ensure you don't accidentally delete all your items.
